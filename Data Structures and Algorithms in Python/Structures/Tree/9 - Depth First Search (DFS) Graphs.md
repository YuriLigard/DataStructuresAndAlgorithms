- Graphs can have cycles 
	- need to keep track of visited vertices 

- **Steps:**
	- 1. Start at any vertex
	- 2. Tracks current vertex to visited vertices list 
	- 3. For each current node's adjacent vertex
		- If it has been visited -> **ignore it**
		- If it hasn't been visited -> recursively perform DFS
