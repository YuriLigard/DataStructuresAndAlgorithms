- Follows **divide and conquer**
	- **Divide**
		- divides the problem into smaller sub-problems 
	- **Conquer**
		- sub-problems are solved recursively
	- **Combine**
		- solutions of sub-problems are combined to achieve the final solution

# Complexity

- Worst case: O (n log n)
	- suitable for sorting large lists

- Average case: &Theta;(n log n)
- Best case: &Omega;(n log( n)
- **Space complexity:** O(n)
	- worst space complexity than other algorithms with O(1)

- **Other variants reduce this space complexity**
